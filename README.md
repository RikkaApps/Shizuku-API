# Shizuku-API

The API and the developer guide for [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) and [Sui](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Sui).

The concept is "same API, different implementation", Shizuku and Sui shares the API design. As the application developer, you only need to write the code once to support both Shizuku and Sui.

## Introduction

First of all, please read the README of [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) and [Sui](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Sui), so that you will have a basic understanding of how Shizuku and Sui works.

The most important functions provided by Shizuku API is "remote binder call" and "user service". 

### Remote binder call

Call any Android APIs which uses binder (such as `getInstalledPackages`) as the identity of root (or adb).

### User service

Similar to [Bound services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services), but the service runs as the identity of root (or adb). JNI is also supported.

## Requirements

To use apps using Shizuku API, the user needs to install Shizuku or Sui first.

#### Sui

- Requires two Magisk modules, "Riru" and "Riru - Sui"

#### Shizuku

- Requires root or adb
  - For adb, it's required to manually restart with adb every time on boot
  - For adb, of course, only has limited permissions of adb
- Requires the user to install a standalone app, Shizuku

### Make a choice

For root-only apps, continue to support the old school "su" or not, you may have to make this choice.

Since Sui is possible to be bundled in Magisk in the future (Riru is already in Magisk), abandon old school "su" is not a bad choice.

For existing applications, there is an API that allows you to create a "sh" as root (or adb), so you can always do what was previously possible.

### Migrating from "su"

* Simple applications which only use commands like `pm` `am`

  Use "Remote binder call".

* Complicated applications such as root file managers

  Use "User service".

* Complicated applications which heavily depend on commands in Linux world

  Use "User service" with JNI or continue to use shell.

## Guide

Note, something is not mentioned below, please be sure to read the [demo](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku-API/tree/master/demo).

### Add dependency

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/dev.rikka.shizuku/api)

   
```
def shizuku_version = '11.0.3'
implementation "dev.rikka.shizuku:api:$shizuku_version"

// Add this line if you want to support Shizuku
implementation "dev.rikka.shizuku:provider:$shizuku_version"
```

Since all root users using Shizuku will eventually switch to Sui, if your application requires root, it's better not to support Shizuku from the begining.

### Acquire the Binder

The only API difference of Shizuku and Sui is the method of acquiring the Binder. If this step is not done, methods from `Shizuku` class will throw a `IllegalStateException` with "binder haven't been received".

#### Sui

Call `Sui.init(packageName)` before using `Shizuku` class. This method only needs to be called once.

If this method returns true, means Sui is installed and available. If not, Sui maybe not installed or the user hide the application in Sui.

For multi-process applications, call this method in every process which needs to use Shizuku API.

#### Shizuku

**DO NOT this if your app only supports Sui.**

Add `ShizukuProvider` to `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```
<provider
    android:name="rikka.shizuku.ShizukuProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.shizuku"
    android:multiprocess="false"
    android:enabled="true"
    android:exported="true"
    android:permission="android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL" />
```

For multi-process applications, call `ShizukuProvider.enableMultiProcessSupport( /* is current process the same process of ShizukuProvider's */ )` in every process which needs to use Shizuku API.

### Request permission

Requesting the permission of Shizuku/Sui is similar to [requesting runtime permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting). The only difference is you need to use methods from `Shizuku` class. See demo for more.

### Use

See demo.

## Migration guide for existing applications use Shizuku pre-v11

### Changes

- Dependency changed (see Guide below)
- Self-implemented permission is used from v11, the API is same to runtime permission (see demo, and existing runtime permission still works)
- Package name is rename to `rikka.shizuku` (replace all `moe.shizuku.api.` to `rikka.shizuku.`)
- `ShizukuService` class is renamed to `Shizuku`
- Methods in `Shizuku` class now throw `RuntimeException` rather than `RemoteException` like other Android APIs
- Listeners are moved from `ShizukuProvider` class to `Shizuku` class

### Add support for Sui

- Call `Sui#init()`
- It's better to use check Sui with `Sui#isSui` before using Shizuku only methods in `ShizukuProvider`
